* Melissa Crnic (Ladies Learning Code): would attend
* Lukas Blakk (Ascend): would attend
* Julie Elman (Girl Develop It): interested
* Katherine Fellows (ClojureBridge): has been contacted
* Bridget Hillyer (ClojureBridge): interested
  * I directly know some folks involved with Ada Developers Academy,
    Code 2040, Double Union (I'm a member!), Girl Develop It, Lambda
    Ladies (also a member!), Lesbians Who Tech, Pyladies, RailsBridge,
    TechGirlz (the founder's a friend of mine!), and Trans*H4ck.
  * Black Girls Code is based in Oakland, where I live, so presumably
    it shouldn't be too hard to get ahold of someone. The same applies
    for Women Who Code, which is based in San Francisco.
  * Also, I know a couple of people in Chicago who could probably put
    me in touch with the Chicago Women Developers, if no one else has
    a connection there. The same goes for basically anything
    Python-related, as I attended Hackbright Academy (they teach
    Python to women, but are for-profit) and know a guy on the DSF
    board.
* Jessica Kerr: interested
* Joan Touzet: interested
