Have been the director of CWDevs for 5 years, we have been teaching women in urban environments how to program computers and find support networks and jobs in Chicago.

We often participate in mentoring STEM eduction in schools, building NFP websites (we've done so for girlscouts) as well as building better database and crisis tools for the Red Cross.  Mostly, we offer low cost of free computing classes as well as a safe space to come on a weekly basis with computing questions and projects.

I am self taught, was raised in a household where it was expected I'd be a wife and mother and no more. I've worked my way to be the COO of a company, and the leader of a strong and thriving community.
