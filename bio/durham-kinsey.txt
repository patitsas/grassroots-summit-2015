@KinseyAnnDurham

- Board member of BridgeFoundry (www.bridgefoundry.org) and long-time volunteer/participant of Railsbridge. I have taught over 300 women to teach code in this format. I am the leader for Railsbridge in Colorado, currently.
- Also, I was a teaching assistant for gSchool, which is a sixth month coding school in Denver, Boulder, SF. 50% of the class was female and included many men and women of color and LGQBT.

- I have a very different background than most developers (ie. no CS background, self-taught and do not conform to any stereotypes)
- I am from Albuquerque, New Mexico and speak spanish.
- Passion!
- Age.I am not sure the age range? but I am 24.
