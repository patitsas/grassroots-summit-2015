I am working with a foundation implementing access CS for NYC Public School Children.  I was also on the Equity committee for CSTA from 2004-2008.

I have been involved with Girls Who Code, starting the Academy for Software Engineering, and lately have been working with the gender equity committee for Career and Technical Education (CTE) in NYC.  I work with instructional practice and institutional barriers for young people, especially of color who are not autodidacts and for whom "There is a website that teaches that" does not mean equal access.  There is too much to write here in 2000 characters.

I have been working in the CSED space since 1997.  I am a policy wonk (Running on Empty), a teacher, a facilitator, a professional developer, a education researcher, a computer scientist, an advocate, a textbook author and many other things.
