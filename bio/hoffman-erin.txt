I have held multiple executive positions and been involved with outreach through MSU Women in Computing (I'm the 2014-2015 president).  Our outreach activities include running workshops on Scratch and HTML/CSS for girl scouts as well as girls from an inner-city STEM academy.  My background as a teaching assistant in a freshman-level Python course has helped with this.

I am going to be helping Teresa VanderSloot run the computer science camps at Michigan State this summer.  I was also a top 3 finisher at HackMIT 2014 and TreeHacks (Stanford's hackathon) 2015, and strongly believe that the maker/hacker/tinkerer movement can make positive contributions to STEM education.
