Kathryn Barrett is a creative coder, maker, doer and educator currently living in Toronto. She is the Youth Program Lead at Ladies Learning Code, a not-for-profit organization that runs beginner-friendly tech education programs for women and youth all across Canada. She is passionate about encouraging young girls to be resourceful makers (and not just consumers) of technology, and is all about promoting code and maker tools as creative outlets.

Our organization has grown rapidly over the past 2 years or so, and so has our audience. With that, I've been experiencing teaching more and more under privileged youth who have barely touched a computer, youth with medicated learning disabilities (particularly ADHD, dyslexia and Aspergers), and teenage youth who are experiencing difficult times at home and/or at school. All of these experiences have been encountered with little to no prior knowledge on the subject matter, but all seem to end in the same result: youth leave our programs feeling really excited about technology and code.
