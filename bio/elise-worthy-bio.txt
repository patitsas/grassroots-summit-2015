I am a self-taught programmer with a background in marketing and project management. In 2010, I struggled to learn programming on my own and decided the best way to learn was to seek out other newbies - through this, I cofounded RailsBridge's Seattle chapter. After going through a developer bootcamp in Washington DC (Hungry Academy, sponsored by LivingSocial) and spending some time as developer, I cofounded Ada.
