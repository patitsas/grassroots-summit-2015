Shannon Turner is a full-stack developer and the founder of Hear Me Code, a nonprofit offering free, beginner-friendly women-only coding classes for over 1000 women in DC.  In addition to teaching and designing Hear Me Code’s curriculum, she also serves as a mentor and works to turn students into teachers. Her full portfolio is available at http://shannonvturner.com.

I run a nonprofit called Hear Me Code, which offers free, beginner-friendly women-only coding classes.
Our mission is to broaden the tech sector’s talent pool by lowering barriers to entry and creating a safe, supportive environment for women to learn, grow, and innovate.
I began teaching in September 2013 with just four students around my kitchen table and since then, Hear Me Code has grown to over 900 members.
For the first eight months, I taught every class but since then have been focusing on turning students into teaching assistants and teachers -- and now over 40 women have taken on these leadership roles.
Hear Me Code also focuses on peer mentoring and leadership development. Rather than producing cookie-cutter coders, Hear Me Code is about building up women and creating a safe space to learn and grow.
