I am a black women in computing and manage community for women in computing (Systers) and other affinity communities within Systers. I also work with CMD-IT (Center for Minorities and People with Disabilities in Information Technology) where minorities also include Blacks, Hispanics, Native Americans and people with disabilities. I mentor people from these groups in open source projects using open source technologies including educating them in entire software development lifecycle. Teaching classes in using GitHub, Python and Android development.

Technology has been a great conduit for social justice responses such as the young Atlanta teen group developing an app, Five-O, for black community to give their feedback on their experiences with law enforcement. Many initiatives in social justice is not reactionary, but helping to deter these types of incidence through education and technology. I've volunteered with groups in Georgia like Black Girls Code, Technologies of Color, PyLadies ATL and RailsGirls Atlanta and RailsBridge Savannah to help K-12 kids, black and hispanics in mobile application, web development and emerging trends in technology. I've also been involved with Black Women in Computing Gaming workshop and Pathway to Stem parent panels. Getting our community to really understand the opportunities there are in technology can help increase their curiosity about technology and inspire them to take the tech path.

As an African American women in tech, I'm also a huge advocate for other underrepresented minorities and those in under served communities. I have extensive experience in outreach initiatives and networks expands deep within these communities through strong relationship building.
