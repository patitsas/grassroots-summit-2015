I have been involved with tech education both in New York City and in Colorado at the Loveland CreatorSpace. As a career changer into programming (from journalism), I have struggled to find teaching methods that have worked for my particular learning style. Through my own experience as a teacher's assistant in coding courses, I developed a passion and intuition for adapting to meet my various students' needs. I am extremely passionate about creating more tools and opportunities to advance underrepresented groups in the field of technology. I envision a future where I can easily build a technical team with at least 50% female programmers of varied backgrounds.
