I am a self-taught programmer with a background in marketing and project management. In 2010, I struggled to learn programming on my own and decided the best way to learn was to seek out other newbies - through this, I cofounded RailsBridge's Seattle chapter. After going through a developer bootcamp in Washington DC (Hungry Academy, sponsored by LivingSocial) and spending some time as developer, I cofounded Ada Developers Academy.

Ada Developers Academy is a year-long software development school for women in Seattle. We're nonprofit and tuition-free. Our program includes 7 months of full time classroom instruction with 5 months of internship. We're 2 years old and have graduated 15 students, with 100% job placement so far. By the end of 2015, 85 women will be taught software development through Ada.
