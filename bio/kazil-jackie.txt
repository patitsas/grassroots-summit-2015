* Tech training program for Vets
* Pyladies 

I have worked on multiple projects over the years:
* Pyladies 
* We the people: https://petitions.whitehouse.gov/
* Journalism reporter -- my favorites were analysis of location of where a library is placed (or not places) and the demographics of who attends city meetings. 
* Tech training program for Vets

My family is Czech. My mother wanted to be an architect, but her mother made her go into beauty school. :-(

I am self-trained have worked in a variety of journalism and civic hacker and government rolls.
