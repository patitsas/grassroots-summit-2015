I was a middle school teacher for 5 years, during which I mostly taught wealthy white children from greater Boston, but also had international students, American students of color, and high-poverty students regularly. I taught one summer in a program that gives inner-city kids the background to get into prep schools & Boston's exam schools. As a librarian, I've taught workshops to librarians, who are generally middle-aged white women, and as such have a different set of learning needs and cultural characteristics from the stereotypical techie.

I'm on the advisory board of the Ada Initiative. I think the disability community's mantra of "nothing about us without us" is a good starting place; social justice initiatives can too easily be dominated by the least marginal voices, and conscious intersectionality & decentering by those of us who are relatively privileged is a critical starting point.

My current work (all freelance): Django contractor, writer & speaker on library technology issues. I have a forthcoming Library Technology Report from ALA TechSource on short programs librarians write as part of their work and I recently keynoted the code4lib conference (my talk is relevant to the social justice question above). I cotaught the first Software Carpentry workshop for librarians.
