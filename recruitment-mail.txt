Subject title: Invitation: Meeting for grassroots orgs trying to increase diversity in tech

Hello organizers of (ORG),

I'd like to invite you to a summit meeting in Boulder this June for grassroots organizations that teach computing to groups that are underrepresented in tech, including girls and women, LGBT+ individuals, people of color, the disabled, the elderly, and the economically disadvantaged. The aim is to swap experiences, give each other demo lessons, and get some tutorials on non-profit governance, fundraising, and transitioning learners to open source and employment.

We're aiming for about 40 attendees in order to ensure a lively, friendly, meeting. We have already raised $17.5K for travel support, and have more in the pipeline. If you or somebody else from your organization would like to attend, please let us know, and if you have any questions or suggestions, please contact us at summit2015@training-up.org.

Thanks for your time - we look forward to hearing from you.
