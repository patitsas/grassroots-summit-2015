We are organizing a two-day meeting on June 6-7 in Boulder, CO for organizers and members of grassroots learn-to-code projects that are focusing on under-represented groups, including women, people of color, LGBT+, the disabled, and the economically disadvantaged.  The vision for this conference is to deepen the impact of existing efforts by sharing best practices to build capacity in fundraising, non-profit governance, teaching techniques, and community building.

If you would like to take part, please go to http://t3summit.org/how-to-attend/ and fill in the short form linked there.  Thanks to the generosity of the Sloan Foundation, John and Laura Arnold, GitHub, and the Python Software Foundation, we are able to provide travel grants of up to $1000 to a limited number of attendees, so please indicate if you will need such support.

Thank you for your attention and consideration - we look forward to meeting you.
