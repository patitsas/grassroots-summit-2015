All over the world, grassroots groups are trying to fix the tech sectorâ€™s diversity problem. Whether they focus on women, racial minorities, the elderly, LGBT individuals, or people with disabilities, their goal is to foster greater diversity in tech.

We are organizing a meeting in May 2015 to give representatives of these groups a chance to share ideas and make connections through lightning talks, demonstration lessons, and tutorials on non-profit governance, fundraising, and how to help people move from workshops to contributing to open source projects and getting hired.  The organizers include Lukas Blakk (founder of the Ascend project), Leigh Honeywell (of the Ada Initiative), Mike Hoye (Firefox Engineering Community Manager at Mozilla), Cindee Madison (leading the Women in Technology program at NumFOCUS), Elizabeth Patitsas (a graduate student at the University of Toronto), and Greg Wilson (Executive Director of the Software Carpentry Foundation).

We need your help to make this meeting a success.  You can:

* lend a hand with organization,

* introduce us to groups that ought to attend,

* attend yourself,

* assist in fundraising,

* become a sponsor, or

* connect us with people who can do any or all of the above.
