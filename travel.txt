Hi Rose,

Thanks again for agreeing to take part in Teaching Tech Together in Boulder on June 6-7.  We've finalized arrangements for travel, so here are the next steps:

1. We will book a room for you at the Hyatt Place Boulder (2280 Junction Pl, Boulder CO 80301, +1 303 442 0160) for the nights of June 5-6.  We'll pay for the room directly, so please let us know as soon as you can if (a) you are bringing children or other dependents, (b) you have any accessibility needs, or (c) you would like to arrive earlier or stay later.

2. We will reimburse you for your flight and other travel expenses immediately after the event.  (We'll need digital copies of receipts - scans or photos are fine.)  The meeting will run all day Saturday, but we'll wrap around 1:00 pm on Sunday so that people who are headed east can get back to Denver airport for their flights - anything after 4:00 pm on Sunday should give you plenty of margin.

3. Please also let us know as soon as you can roughly how much your travel costs will be - if there's any part of your stipend you don't need, we'd like to redirect it to support others' travel.  The hotel will be about $350 per person for the two nights, leaving about $650 for air fare, taxis, etc.  (SuperShuttle does a round-trip from Denver Airport to Boulder for about $56.)

Thanks once again for taking part - we look forward to meeting you in six weeks.

Best regards,
Greg Wilson [for the organizers]
