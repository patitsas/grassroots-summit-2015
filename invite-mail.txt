Hello!

Thank you for your interest in the Teaching Tech Together meeting on June 6-7 in Boulder.  We're very pleased to be able to invite you to attend, and to offer you a grant of up to $1000 to help with travel and accommodation.  We'll have more details about the agenda, and about booking travel, soon; for now, please confirm that you'll be able to join us,  and send us a few sentences describing your background and the project(s) you're involved in that we can circulate to other attendees.  If you have any questions, feel free to drop us a note at summit2015@t3summit.org!

Thanks again - we look forward to meeting you in June.
